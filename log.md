# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on layout for my future portfolio, just lorem ipsum and flexbox for clarity

**Thoughts:** Really early phase of my work, just css, and simple JS. Final project will be in React with JSON providing simple and functional info about me, and so on. I still work with codepen, but when the project will be mature enough, I will move to github, It's simpler that way.
Still not happy with how the left navigation looks, the *email me* part should be lower. after all I could create two separate divs for mobile and desktop view.

### Day 2: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
  * Worked on setting up github, gh-pages branch, updating my gh-pages branch with simple `git checkout gh-pages && git rebase master`.
  * Made changes on structure of folders on my potfolio branch
  * Tweaking CSS for the portfolio layout

**Thoughts:** Today I have a really bad hangover, like I slept till 4pm. But the force is kinda strong with me, and i managed to sit for an hour and work on things that had to be done. I've got a good plan in my head, but I think it's necessary to make workplan in something like Trello. I guess I'll take care of it tomorow, and publish my trello cards.

### Day 3: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
  
  * Tweaked my system fonts a little bit, now using Monoid for VS Code, and Iosevka for Terminal. Looking good, looking good :D 
I have a little problem with whitelisting *.fonts/* folder to my `.gitignore file`. I should look it with fresh eyes tomorow.(UPDATE: (two hours later), fixed it, a good shower was enough)
  * Worked on my CV, and sent some e-mails to companies that I would like to work with
  * began working on @freecodecamps Calculator challange, but it was really hard to make any progress with amount of non-developement job.

**Thoughts:** Today I devoted my time for some non-developement, although very important stuff regarding my future career in developement matter. I guess that cleaning my git repositories and tweaking my `.vimrc` and `.bashrc` is kinda working towards developement.

### Day 4: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
  * Finished calculator layout, not extremely proud of it, but it's fixed size challange. If I were to make fully responsive microservice, I would design it a little different. Used a bit of flexbox, some relative sizing. Overall it's done. JS is more important

**Thoughts:** After 8 hours in front of the computer at work it's pretty hard do accomplish something at home, but I'm not giving up, not for now at least ;)

### Day 5: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today was a good day, I recieved a task from company I'm trying to work for. I need to code Hangman game. Preferably React, or other JS framework. Did basic layout, figured out how to handle keypress event. It's gonna work, I know it. I've got time until friday to finish, but the sooner the better.

**Thoughts:** I quickly give up when I see a large piece of work to be done. I need to work with small pieces of code, small tasks. But I am learning every day, every day something new. Even if I wouldn't get the job, I will know and learn so much. Of course it's a hard work, after 8 hours of daily job, but it's a pleasure for me (not so much for my girlfriend :D ).

### Day 6: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on dataflow of Hangman game in ReactJS

**Thoughts:** if you don't know framework, creating an app with complex dataflow is a bit hard... Bit upset about progress, nothing seemed to work fine... but tomorrow is another day ;)

### Day 7: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Managed to make the most important logic right. Also styled Mr Hangman with external images. Still some things to do...

**Thoughts:** The success is the greatest fuel for me. Even with small challanges.

### Day 8: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished coding Hangman Game. It's not perfect, but it's working. Next step is to 'prettify' it, and user-proof it, because as I said it's not perfect

**Thoughts:** On wednesday I really thought I couldn't make it, but putting enough work into something pays off. Besides, I had my 'aha!' momemnts during this project, regarding react, and That really helped too!

### Day 9: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Tweaked Hangman game, still got problems with Retina displays. There were also some issues with logic, needed to specify my if statements a bit more.

**Thoughts:** I really don't know if the logic behind the game is good, It works, but is it production-ready code? I don't think so. Well I'll find out soon.

### Day 10: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started front-end interview task for another company. Finished setting up webpack, webpack-dev-server, standard JS.

**Thoughts:** not many things done, but surely a productive day, tweaked some of my previous Hangman Game stuff, every time I setup webpack I understand it better.

### Day 11: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Tried to set up webpack and node modules for react/sass app, failed miserably. Don't understand webpack so much, and this is the big '-'

**Thoughts:** today was a bit on the down side, didn't accomplish anything at all. I'm frustrated, and one clear option in this matter would be just to find mentor...
