# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**:Fixed CSS, worked on layout for my future portfolio, just lorem ipsum and flexbox for clarity

**Thoughts:** Really early phase of my work, just css, and simple JS. Final project will be in React with JSON providing simple and functional info about me, and so on. I still work with codepen, but when the project will be mature enough, I will move to github, It's simpler that way.
Still not happy with how the left navigation looks, the *email me* part should be lower. after all I could create two separate divs for mobile and desktop view.

### Day 2: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
  * Worked on setting up github, gh-pages branch, updating my gh-pages branch with simple `git checkout gh-pages && git rebase master`.
  * Made changes on structure of folders on my potfolio branch
  * Tweaking CSS for the portfolio layout

**Thoughts:** Today I have a really bad hangover, like I slept till 4pm. But the force is kinda strong with me, and i managed to sit for an hour and work on things that had to be done. I've got a good plan in my head, but I think it's necessary to make workplan in something like Trello. I guess I'll take care of it tomorow, and publish my trello cards.
