# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**:Fixed CSS, worked on layout for my future portfolio, just lorem ipsum and flexbox for clarity

**Thoughts:** Really early phase of my work, just css, and simple JS. Final project will be in React with JSON providing simple and functional info about me, and so on. I still work with codepen, but when the project will be mature enough, I will move to github, It's simpler that way.
Still not happy with how the left navigation looks, the *email me* part should be lower. after all I could create two separate divs for mobile and desktop view.
