# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on layout for my future portfolio, just lorem ipsum and flexbox for clarity

**Thoughts:** Really early phase of my work, just css, and simple JS. Final project will be in React with JSON providing simple and functional info about me, and so on. I still work with codepen, but when the project will be mature enough, I will move to github, It's simpler that way.
Still not happy with how the left navigation looks, the *email me* part should be lower. after all I could create two separate divs for mobile and desktop view.

### Day 2: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
  * Worked on setting up github, gh-pages branch, updating my gh-pages branch with simple `git checkout gh-pages && git rebase master`.
  * Made changes on structure of folders on my potfolio branch
  * Tweaking CSS for the portfolio layout

**Thoughts:** Today I have a really bad hangover, like I slept till 4pm. But the force is kinda strong with me, and i managed to sit for an hour and work on things that had to be done. I've got a good plan in my head, but I think it's necessary to make workplan in something like Trello. I guess I'll take care of it tomorow, and publish my trello cards.

### Day 3: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
  
  * Tweaked my system fonts a little bit, now using Monoid for VS Code, and Iosevka for Terminal. Looking good, looking good :D 
I have a little problem with whitelisting *.fonts/* folder to my `.gitignore file`. I should look it with fresh eyes tomorow.(UPDATE: (two hours later), fixed it, a good shower was enough)
  * Worked on my CV, and sent some e-mails to companies that I would like to work with
  * began working on @freecodecamps Calculator challange, but it was really hard to make any progress with amount of non-developement job.

**Thoughts:** Today I devoted my time for some non-developement, although very important stuff regarding my future career in developement matter. I guess that cleaning my git repositories and tweaking my `.vimrc` and `.bashrc` is kinda working towards developement.

### Day 4: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 
  * Finished calculator layout, not extremely proud of it, but it's fixed size challange. If I were to make fully responsive microservice, I would design it a little different. Used a bit of flexbox, some relative sizing. Overall it's done. JS is more important

**Thoughts:** After 8 hours in front of the computer at work it's pretty hard do accomplish something at home, but I'm not giving up, not for now at least ;)

### Day 5: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today was a good day, I recieved a task from company I'm trying to work for. I need to code Hangman game. Preferably React, or other JS framework. Did basic layout, figured out how to handle keypress event. It's gonna work, I know it. I've got time until friday to finish, but the sooner the better.

**Thoughts:** I quickly give up when I see a large piece of work to be done. I need to work with small pieces of code, small tasks. But I am learning every day, every day something new. Even if I wouldn't get the job, I will know and learn so much. Of course it's a hard work, after 8 hours of daily job, but it's a pleasure for me (not so much for my girlfriend :D ).

### Day 6: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on dataflow of Hangman game in ReactJS

**Thoughts:** if you don't know framework, creating an app with complex dataflow is a bit hard... Bit upset about progress, nothing seemed to work fine... but tomorrow is another day ;)

****************************************************************************************************

### Day 7: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Managed to make the most important logic right. Also styled Mr Hangman with external images. Still some things to do...

**Thoughts:** The success is the greatest fuel for me. Even with small challanges.

****************************************************************************************************

### Day 8: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished coding Hangman Game. It's not perfect, but it's working. Next step is to 'prettify' it, and user-proof it, because as I said it's not perfect

**Thoughts:** On wednesday I really thought I couldn't make it, but putting enough work into something pays off. Besides, I had my 'aha!' momemnts during this project, regarding react, and That really helped too!

****************************************************************************************************

### Day 9: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Tweaked Hangman game, still got problems with Retina displays. There were also some issues with logic, needed to specify my if statements a bit more.

**Thoughts:** I really don't know if the logic behind the game is good, It works, but is it production-ready code? I don't think so. Well I'll find out soon.

### Day 10: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started front-end interview task for another company. Finished setting up webpack, webpack-dev-server, standard JS.

**Thoughts:** not many things done, but surely a productive day, tweaked some of my previous Hangman Game stuff, every time I setup webpack I understand it better.

****************************************************************************************************

### Day 11: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Tried to set up webpack and node modules for react/sass app, failed miserably. Don't understand webpack so much, and this is the big '-'

**Thoughts:** today was a bit on the down side, didn't accomplish anything at all. I'm frustrated, and one clear option in this matter would be just to find mentor...

### Day 12: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Managed to setup webpack: htmlwebpackplugin, standard jslint, babel, react, sass, extract-text. Now I've got template for making apps with react. big + for webpack: __webpack-dashboard__

**Thoughts:** Sometimes you just got to sleep, and the solution comes right after, in the morning. The tasks i did today are not coding, but are coding-related. I think it counts

****************************************************************************************************

### Day 13: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did some reading about css frameworks like bootstrap and skeleton. Also more reading about Bourbon mixins for sass

**Thoughts:** It's all because of sherlocks season 4 finale. I'm a little worn out

### Day 14: January 19, 2017

**Thoughts:** today was travel day, unfortunately after work I had to go to my hometown, I wasn't able to code a lot. Tomorow on the other hand, I've got whole day to code my projects! :)

### Day 15-17: January 20-22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Still monterail recruitment task, much pain.

****************************************************************************************************

### Day 18: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Streamed for 2-3 hours and fixed some things on my portfolio on github. When you do something because you like it it is much better than under a lot of pressure.

**Thoughts:**  I don't say that pressure is not good. PRESSURE IS GOOD. But if you're lacking knowledge, helping hand and have limited time it is really devastating. Sometimes gitter and forums are not enough for feedback. I need a real person to teach me. A master. Because I'm one with the force, and the force is with me!

### Day 19: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Streamed for 2hours, finished v1 of my portfolio. Also spent a bit of time on a component for displaying potfolio projects on page

**Thoughts:** Really nice and chill evening, I enjoy streaming, I am aware that my content is extra begginners stuff, but still, if someone asks me how I did something I'm super excited!
